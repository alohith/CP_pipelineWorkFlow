New rational... I want to easily edit them from TextMate without having to drill down a package hiearchy...





----------------------------------------------------------------------
*  OK, I was wrong about this... Groovy is VERY forgiving about package imports
*  At least when the relevant jar files are in groovy/lib/ 
* 

*What are all of these .java files doing here without any packages?  
*This is basically the kitchen sink.   The purpose is to provide classes that add 
*functionality to Groovy without having to remember their package names and what not. 
*Sure, that's what Eclipse is for, but unlike Java, most of my Groovy code is less than 
*one page long, edited in TextMate, and started and finished in less than an hour.  It's
*a different development model, and what I want out of Groovy is for lots of useful functionality 
*to "just be there".
