durbinlib.jar 

The idea is simple.  This is the Kitchen Sink.   Whenever I develop some 
highly useful utility class, I'll put in here so that I can just grab 
durbinlib.jar and have all my Favorites in one fell swoop.  It's called 
durbinlib because I expect that my own personal usage cases will be the 
only real commonality.   I don't want to have to think about it, I just 
want to write the java code and forget about it.  

Mainly this is for Groovy.  Groovy is great, but there are some things that 
I need to do frequently that I need to do either more cleanly or with faster 
code than I can in Groovy. For example, consider the Perl tr() functionality. 
That's handy for a DNA guy who frequently needs to change characters in a string 
from one set into those in another set.  Groovy-only versions of this I have 
written are too slow by a factor of 10. 

Doing "ant install" here will copy durbinlib.jar into ~/.groovy/lib where it will immediately 
be available to any Groovy scripts.

========================

NOTE:  The current install script needs Ant 1.7 or later.  
Ant 1.6.5 in particular will not work correctly with this build.xml.
